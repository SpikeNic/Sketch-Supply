For this project I made a website for a streetwear business that's located in Iowa. I used html, some javaScript and css. 

I chose to use google maps API and I used it for the location page to show where the location of the store is.

I would make it in bootstrap first, because I wanted to use bootstrap later in the project and it was really hard to integrate because it clashed with my existing css styles and class/ids.

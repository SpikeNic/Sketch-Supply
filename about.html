    <h1>About Sketch Supply</h1>
  
    <p><strong>Sketch Supply</strong> was born from a notebook full of scribbles, late-night dreams, and a passion for raw self-expression. What started as a side hustle — designing tees in a cramped bedroom — quickly evolved into a streetwear brand that reflects the voice of the underdog, the creator, the everyday rebel.</p>
  
    <p>Our mission is simple: empower people to wear their story, stay unapologetically original, and keep creating — even when no one’s watching. Every drop is crafted with intention, inspired by street culture, creativity, and that sketchbook mentality of always being in progress.</p>
